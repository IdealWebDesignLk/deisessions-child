 	<li>Our Platform is not a recommendation or endorsement of any Expert Speaker or its products and services.</li>

 	<li>This Platform is offered and available to users who are at least 18 years of age and of legal age to form a binding contract. If you are under 18 and at least 13 years of age, you are only permitted to use the Platform through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission.

<ol>
 	<li>All intellectual and industrial property rights arising from the Agreement, including but not limited to all portrait rights, copyrights, neighbouring rights, database rights, trademark rights, design rights and patents, will accrue exclusively to IWDsessions.com, its licensors or its suppliers, and the Client acknowledges this, unless the Parties have explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.</li>
 	<li>If intellectual or industrial property rights are concerned that are subject to a registration obligation, these will be registered exclusively in IWDsessions.com's name and IWDsessions.com will be the sole party entitled to do so, unless the Parties have explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.</li>
 	<li>The Agreement in no way entails the transfer of any intellectual and industrial property rights of IWDsessions.com's Services to the Client. Insofar as necessary for the provision of the Services, the Client only acquires the rights of use in respect of the Services actually used by the Client. If IWDsessions.com develops Services in the context of the Agreement which are not used by the Client, these Services shall remain outside the right of use, unless the Parties explicitly agree otherwise in writing. Any other or further right of the Client to reproduce or publish these Services or materials is excluded, unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.</li>
 	<li>A right of use to which Client is entitled in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement is non-exclusive and non-transferable and cannot be (sub)licensed to third parties, all this without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 4 of this article.

 	<li>IWDsessions.com has, with due regard for the Client's interests, unlimited freedom to use the design for its own publicity or promotion.</li>
 	<li>The Services developed by IWDsessions.com in the context of the Agreement, which in any case but not exclusively includes presentations and other materials or (electronic) files, remain IWDsessions.com's property, regardless of whether they are made available to the Client or to third parties, unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.</li>

<h5>
<strong>Article 5:  Payment /Invoicing</strong>	
						</h5>
<ol>
 	<li>The fees and amounts to be charged in these General Terms and Conditions are in Euros and are exclusive of sales tax (VAT) and other government levies.</li>
 	<li>IWDsessions.com is entitled to charge its fee at the moment of Booking or within 5 working days after the Booking and at least before the IWD session is scheduled.</li>
 	<li>Payment must be made within 5 working days of the Booking date. Objections to the amount of the invoices do not suspend the payment obligation.</li>
 	<li>The Client shall make the payments owed to IWDsessions.com without any discount or compensation.</li>
 	<li>If the government and/or trade unions introduce changes to wages, employment conditions, social insurance etc. between the date on which the Agreement is entered into and the Agreement is performed, IWDsessions.com is entitled to pass on the increases to the Client.</li>
 	<li>If the term of payment is exceeded, the Client shall owe default damages from the due date, even without a notice of default being required, equal to the statutory interest as stipulated in Section 6:119 of the Dutch Civil Code.</li>
 	<li>From the moment that the Client does not (fully) fulfill his payment obligations under the Agreement or is otherwise in default, the Client is no longer permitted to use the Services supplied and any license granted to the Client under the Agreement will lapse, unless the Client's default is of minor significance in light of the assignment as a whole.</li>
 	<li>From the due date, Client shall also owe extrajudicial costs on the outstanding invoice amount. The extrajudicial collection costs are set at a minimum of 10% of the invoice amount with a minimum of € 150 (one hundred and fifty euro).</li>
 	<li>IWDsessions.com may, without being in default of payment, refuse full repayment of the principal sum if the accrued and current interest and the extrajudicial costs are not also paid.</li>
 	<li>Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Client shall be obliged to pay the full legal costs.</li>
 	<li>If Client fails to provide accurate invoice details within 7 days from booking a IWD session, IWDsessions.com has the right to cancel the IWD session.</li>

<h5>
<strong>Article 6: Rescheduling &amp; cancellations</strong>	
						</h5>
<ol>
 	<li>Should you want to reschedule, this is only an option at the discretion of the Expert Speaker. If the Expert Speaker is not able to reschedule, the original fee needs to be paid.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
 	<li>. If you cancel your IWD session after booking, a cancellation fee of 100% of the original fee applies.</li>
</ol>


<h5><strong>Article 7 - For Expert Speakers</strong>
						</h5>
<ol>
 	<li>Only registered users may offer services on the Platform. Registration is free. In registering for an account, you agree to provide us with accurate, complete and updated information and must not create an account for fraudulent or misleading purposes. You are solely responsible for any activity on your account and for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your password. We are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your account.</li>
 	<li>2.	A Booking will be considered “in option” for 5 working days from the moment of booking. The Expert Speaker will keep this time slot available for these 5 working days. IWDsessions.com will confirm the booking within these 5 working days.</li>
 	<li>3.	As IWD Sessions is launched as a pilot, no fee will be applicable for the Expert Speakers - the amount reflecting the price of the session as offered by the Expert Speaker will be paid in full to the Expert Speaker within 5 working days after the session.</li>
	<li>4.  A service fee will apply to each booked IWD session that the Expert will pay to IWDsessions.com, being 4% of the session price as determined by the Expert.</li>
	<li>5. To help create the best possible experience for our Clients, all Expert Speakers must meet four basic requirements:</li>
</ol>
<br>
1 - Keep your calendar up to date
<br>
Clarity of your availability is key to our online booking system. No Client likes to make a booking and find out afterwards you are not available. We make sure your calendar is connected to our system and any bookings will be visible real-time. It is up to you to make sure the time slots marked as available are actually available. 
<br>
2 - Avoid cancelling or rescheduling sessions
<br>
We take cancellations and rescheduling seriously and ask all Expert Speakers to avoid cancelling on clients; whole organisations depend on you. We ask that you avoid cancelling confirmed bookings unless there are extenuating circumstances. 
<br>
3 - Get positive reviews
<br>
Clients like to know they can expect a consistent level of quality, no matter what they book. At the end of each session, they will be asked to review their experience with you, which is one of the ways we evaluate you as a Expert Speaker. Your overall rating will be your average review score from the clients you’ve held sessions with. Once our new website is ready, we plan to start showing this once we have 2 reviews for your session.
<br>
4 - Content
<br>
We expect all Expert Speakers to be considerate of other peoples believes and values.

<br>
